\begin{abstract}
The recent discovery of the constructive use of pairings in cryptography has opened up a wealth of new research options into identity-based encryption. In this paper, we will investigate the possible use of pairings in constrained environments. The focus will be on an small, energy efficient ASIC implementation of an accelerator for the Tate pairing over a supersingular curve.

The results are encouraging for further research. It is possible to obtain an implementation of less than 30k gates. Furthermore, energy efficiency improvements over twenty times compared to other published designs are possible.
