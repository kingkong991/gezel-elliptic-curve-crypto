We propose a custom hardware assisted approach to implement Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in order to obtain stronger cryptography as well as to minimize the power. Our compact and low-power ECC processor contains a Modular Arithmetic Logic Unit (MALU) for ECC field arithmetic. The best solution features 6718 gates for the MALU and control unit (data memory not included) in 0.13 Œºm CMOS technology over the field}},
