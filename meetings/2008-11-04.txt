GEZEL:
	- When assigning things like:

			st_1 = sum2_2 # sum2_1;

	  Is sum2_2 the MSB? See weird output from sum.fdl.

	- Bluetooth exercise: Error in LFSR code? See index of output in reload sfg vs other sfg's.

	- Is there some way to include files? Or should I use cat to concatenate files and pipe this to GEZEL?

	- Why use multiple states and not use tons of if's? Is this slower, bigger, ...? For example see the E0 FSM in bluetooth.fdl.

	- Is there a known correct output of the Bluetooth E0 excercise?

Sakiyama:
	- How exactly does the OR/MUX part of figure 5.3 (p. 109) work?
